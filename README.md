A Golang app for connecting to MiFlora/Flowercare IoT plant sensors.

Why I created this library
This is a personal library that I created because I wanted to use and feed the data from my many plant sensors into my smart home routines. It is by no means complete, although it does expose all of the data from the devices (reversed engineered). As such, this library does not come with unit tests (feel free to add them) or any kind of guarantees.

Contributions are welcome and appreciated!üôè
